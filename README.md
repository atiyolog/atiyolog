- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @atiyolog
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning codes

- I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Audiology at the Faculty of Health Sciences of Istanbul Medeniyet University.
- I give lectures about auditory electrophysiology, hearing aids and cochlear implants.
- In addition, I have consultancy and supervision duties at Istanbul Medeniyet University GÃ¶ztepe Prof. Dr. SÃ¼leyman YalÃ§Ä±n City Hospital. I have conducted studies to reveal the differences in cochlear implant outcomes in specific groups.
- My recent interests involve identifying clinical biomarkers for better diagnosis using routine audiological tools.
- Additionally, I focus on cochlear hearing loss and related concepts such as cochlear synaptopathy, loudness perception, tinnitus, and efferent auditory projections.
